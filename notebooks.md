## Jupyter Notebooks for Use with the TopoFlow Model

* A notebook with an overview and introduction for new users.  [TopoFlow Getting Started Notebook](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/TopoFlow_Getting_Started.ipynb) 

  * A notebook for preparing almost all of the input files that are needed to apply the TopoFlow hydrologic model to a new geographic region. [TopoFlow_Utils_Demo1.ipynb](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/TopoFlow_Utils_Demo1.ipynb)
  
  * A notebook for creating visualizations (optimized color plots and animations) from TopoFlow output files (netCDF). [TopoFlow_Visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/TopoFlow_Visualization.ipynb)
  

## Data Services

The MINT Data Catalog (see [overview](https://mintproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datacatalog/)) provides access to a curated collection of a datasets in the MINT Data Catalog.

The MINT [Data Catalog API](https://data-catalog.mint.isi.edu/documentation) provides a programmatic way of interacting with the datasets. Some of this functionality is demonstrated in the following:

- [Python notebook](https://github.com/mintproject/MINT-DataCatalog-Public/blob/master/demo/api_demo.ipynb) of registering a dataset using API
- [Python notebook](https://github.com/mintproject/MINT-DataCatalog-Public/blob/master/demo/CHIRPS_browse.ipynb) of searching for a dataset using API
