## Jupyter Notebooks for Use with the TopoFlow Model

### Note: Please do not view these notebooks in GitHub, which is slow and does not work well.  Instead, paste their complete URL into the box at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org.  There, notebooks render correctly and very quickly.  Both internal and external links will also work!

 * A notebook with an overview and introduction for new users.  [TopoFlow Getting Started Notebook]
 (https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/notebooks/TopoFlow_Getting_Started.ipynb)

  * A notebook for preparing almost all of the input files that are needed to apply the TopoFlow hydrologic model to a new geographic region. [TopoFlow_Prepare_Input_Data.ipynb](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/notebooks/TopoFlow_Prepare_Input_Data.ipynb)
  
  * A notebook for creating visualizations (optimized color plots and animations) from TopoFlow output files (netCDF). [TopoFlow_Visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/notebooks/TopoFlow_Visualization.ipynb)
  
  * A notebook describing how to do basic model calibration with gauging station data. [TopoFlow_Calibration_Gauge_Data](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/notebooks/TopoFlow_Calibration_Gauge_Data.ipynb)
  
  * A notebook describing how to do basic model calibration with remote sensing data. [TopoFlow_Calibration_Remote_Sensing](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/notebooks/TopoFlow_Calibration_Remote_Sensing.ipynb)
  
  * A notebook for preparing rainfall data for a river basin, using the Baro River as an example. [TopoFlow_Baro_Rainfall_Prep](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/notebooks/TopoFlow_Baro_Rainfall_Prep.ipynb)
  
  * A notebook that compares multiple, global, remotely-sensed rainfall products. [TopoFlow_Rainfall_Inputs](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/blob/master/notebooks/TopoFlow_Rainfall_Inputs.ipynb)
  
  * Several other notebooks can be found in the [TopoFlow Notebooks Folder](https://github.com/peckhams/topoflow36/tree/master/notebooks)
  
## Data Services

The MINT Data Catalog (see [overview](https://mintproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datacatalog/)) provides access to a curated collection of a datasets in the MINT Data Catalog.

The MINT [Data Catalog API](https://data-catalog.mint.isi.edu/documentation) provides a programmatic way of interacting with the datasets. Some of this functionality is demonstrated in the following:

* A [Python notebook](https://github.com/mintproject/MINT-DataCatalog-Public/blob/master/demo/api_demo.ipynb) for registering a dataset using the MINT Data Catalog API

* A [Python notebook](https://github.com/mintproject/MINT-DataCatalog-Public/blob/master/demo/CHIRPS_browse.ipynb) for searching for a dataset using the MINT Data Catalog API

## Scientific Variables

* A [Python notebook](https://github.com/mariutzica/Scientific-Variable-Exploration-Tools/blob/master/Variable%20Report.ipynb) for performing scientific variable searches/exploration and generating SVO-compatible knowledge graphs grounded to SVO variables and WM indicators.
